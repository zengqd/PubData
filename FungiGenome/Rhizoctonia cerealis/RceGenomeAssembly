Rhizoctonia cerealis Van der Hoeven (current teleomorph name: Ceratobasidium cereale Murray & Burpee, Basidiomycota), a member  belongs toof the Rhizoctonia anastomosis AG-D group subgroup I (AG-DI). We generated the first haplotype-resolved and chromosome-level genome for R. cerealis strain R0301. This genome assembly reaches a near-complete standard, characterized by high contiguity and base accuracy. It contained sixteen homologous pairs of chromosomes spanning 82.6 Mbp without gaps, and complete T2T assemblies were achieved for 19 chromosomes.
